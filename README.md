# PP6

## Goal

In this exercise you will:

* Learn how to produce text output to the terminal in four different environments:

  1. **Bash** shell scripting
  2. **GNU Assembler** (GAS) using system calls
  3. **C** via the standard library
  4. **Python 3** using built‑in printing functions

**Important:** Start a stopwatch when you begin and work uninterruptedly for **90 minutes**. When time is up, stop immediately and record exactly where you paused.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** The **workflow** steps have been **updated** for PP6. Please review the new workflow below carefully before proceeding.

## Workflow

1. **Fork** this repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine
3. Create a **solutions** directory at the repository root: `mkdir solutions`
4. For each task, add your solution file into `./solutions/` (e.g., `[solutions/print.sh](./solutions/print.sh)`)
5. **Commit** your changes locally, then **push** to GitHub
6. **Submit** your GitHub repository link for review

---

## Prerequisites

* Several starter repos are available here:
  [https://github.com/orgs/STEMgraph/repositories?q=SSH%3A](https://github.com/orgs/STEMgraph/repositories?q=SSH%3A)

---

> **Note:** Place all your solution files under the `solutions/` directory in your cloned repo.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Bash Printing & Shell Prompt

**Objective:** Use both `echo` and `printf` to format and display text and variables, and customize your shell prompt and login/logout messages.

1. In `./solutions/`, create a file named `print.sh` based on the template below.
2. At the top of `print.sh`, add the shebang:

   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   ```
3. Implement at least three functions:

   * `print_greeting`: prints `Hello from Bash!` using `echo`.
   * `print_vars`: declares two variables (e.g., `name="Bash"`, `version=5.1") and prints them with `printf\` using format specifiers.
   * `print_escape`: demonstrates escape sequences: newline (`\n`), tab (`\t`), and ANSI color codes (e.g., `\e[32m` for green).
4. Make the script executable and verify it runs:

   ```bash
   chmod +x solutions/print.sh
   ./solutions/print.sh
   ```
5. Modify your **`~/.bashrc`** on your local machine to:

   * Change the `PS1` prompt to include your username and current directory (e.g., `export PS1="[\u@\h \W]\$ "`).
   * Display a **welcome** message on login (e.g., `echo "Welcome, $(whoami)!"`).
   * Display a **goodbye** message on logout (add a `trap` for `EXIT` to echo `Goodbye!`).
6. Reload your shell (`source ~/.bashrc`) and demonstrate the prompt, greeting, and exit message.

**Template for `solutions/print.sh`**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

print_greeting() {
    # TODO: echo "Hello from Bash!"
}

print_vars() {
    local name="Bash"
    local version=5.1
    # TODO: printf "Using %s version %.1f\n" "$name" "$version"
}

print_escape() {
    # TODO: printf "This is a newline:\nThis is a tab:\tDone!\n"
    # TODO: printf "\e[32mGreen text\e[0m and normal text\n"
}

# Call your functions:
print_greeting
print_vars
print_escape
```

**Solution Reference**
Place your completed `print.sh` in `solutions/` and commit. Then link it here:

```

```

#### Reflection Questions

1. **What is the difference between `printf` and `echo` in Bash?**
    both printf and echo are used to display text but "printf" provides a greater functionality and larger formatting capabilities.
2. **What is the role of `~/.bashrc` in your shell environment?**
    The shell script ~/.bashrc runs every time a new shell session is started. It contains shell customization settings (e.g. settings for environment variables, shell options or customized shell prompts). 
3. **Explain the difference between sourcing (`source ~/.bashrc`) and executing (`./print.sh`).**
When sourcing a script, the shell runs the script in the current shell environment. When executing a script a new shell process is started to run the script. That means, any changes to the environment do not persist in the original shell.

### Task 2: GAS Printing (32‑bit Linux)

**Objective:** Use the Linux `sys_write` and `sys_exit` system calls in GAS to write text, while ensuring your repo only contains source files.

1. At the repository root, create a file named `.gitignore` that ignores:

   * Object files (`*.o`)
   * Binaries/executables (e.g., `print`, `print_c`)
   * Any editor or OS-specific files
     Commit this `.gitignore` file.
     **Explain:** Why should compiled artifacts and binaries not be committed to a Git repository?
2. In `./solutions/`, create a file named `print.s` using the template below.
3. Define a message in the `.data` section (e.g., `msg: .ascii "Hello from GAS!\n"`, `len = . - msg`).
4. In the `.text` section’s `_start` symbol, invoke `sys_write` (syscall 4) and then `sys_exit` (syscall 1) via `int $0x80`.
5. Assemble and link in 32‑bit mode:

   ```bash
   as --32 -o print.o solutions/print.s
   ld -m elf_i386 -o print print.o
   ```
6. Run `./print` and verify it outputs your message.

**Template for `solutions/print.s`**

```asm
    .section .data
msg:    .ascii "Hello from GAS!\n"
len = . - msg

    .section .text
    .global _start
_start:
    movl $4, %eax        # sys_write
    movl $1, %ebx        # stdout
    movl $msg, %ecx
    movl $len, %edx
    int $0x80

    movl $1, %eax        # sys_exit
    movl $0, %ebx        # status 0
    int $0x80
```

```

#### Reflection Questions

1. **What is a file descriptor and how does the OS use it?**
    
2. **How can you obtain or duplicate a file descriptor for another resource (e.g., a file or socket)?**
3. **What might happen if you use an invalid file descriptor in a syscall?**

---

### Task 3: C Printing

**Objective:** Use `printf` and `puts` from `<stdio.h>` to display formatted data.

1. In `./solutions/`, create `print.c` based on the template below.
2. Implement `main()` to print a greeting, an integer, a float, and a string via `printf`, then use `puts`.
3. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   gcc -std=c11 -Wall -o print_c solutions/print.c
   ./print_c
   ```

**Template for `solutions/print.c`**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello from C!\n");
    printf("Integer: %d, Float: %.2f, String: %s\n", 42, 3.14, "test");
    puts("This is puts output");
    return 0;
}
```

**Solution Reference**

```
[print.c](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/blob/main/solutions/print.c)
```

#### Reflection Questions

1. **Use `objdump -d` on `print_c` to find the assembly instructions corresponding to your `printf` calls.**
2. **Why is the syntax written differently from GAS assembly? Compare NASM vs. GAS notation.**
3. **How could you use `fprintf` to write output both to `stdout` and to a file instead? Provide example code.**

---

### Task 4: Python 3 Printing

**Objective:** Use Python’s `print()` function with various parameters and f‑strings.

1. In `./solutions/`, create `print.py` using the template below.
2. Implement `main()` to print a greeting, multiple values with custom `sep`/`end`, and an f‑string expression.
3. Make it executable and run:

   ```bash
   chmod +x solutions/print.py
   ./solutions/print.py
   ```

**Template for `solutions/print.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def main():
    print("Hello from Python3!")
    print("A", "B", "C", sep="-", end=".\n")
    value = 2 + 2
    print(f"Two plus two equals {value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Solution Reference**

```
[print.py](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/blob/main/solutions/print.py)
```

#### Reflection Questions

1. **Is Python’s print behavior closer to Bash, Assembly, or C? Explain.**
Python is closest to Bash, because to execute it you can simply run the script (after making the file executable) and dont need to compile it first e.g. by using gcc.
2. **Can you inspect a Python script’s binary with `objdump`? Why or why not?**
    No, you cant, because Python script is just a plain text file. There is no binary format.

**Remember:** Stop working after **90 minutes** and document where you stopped.
